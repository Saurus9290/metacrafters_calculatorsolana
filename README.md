# Rust  Calculator for Metacrafters solana project

This project is a simple command-line calculator written in Rust that takes a binary expression (e.g., `3+2`, `4*5`) as input and computes the result. It supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Features

- **Addition** (`+`): Adds two numbers.
- **Subtraction** (`-`): Subtracts the second number from the first.
- **Multiplication** (`*`): Multiplies two numbers.
- **Division** (`/`): Divides the first number by the second. Handles division by zero gracefully.

## Getting Started

To run this project, you'll need to have Rust installed on your machine. If Rust is not installed, you can install it from [Rust's official website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

### Installation
